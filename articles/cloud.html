  <h1>Cloud computing</h1>
  <p>
    Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
    resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power,
    without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used
    to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large
    clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple
    locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is
    relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup>),
    or be available to many organizations (public cloud).
  </p>

  <p>
    Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
    economies of scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows
    companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.
    Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their
    applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less
    maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources
    to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand,<sup>[2]</sup><sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup> providing the burst
    computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak
    demand.<sup>[5]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to
    unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with
    cloud-pricing models.<sup>[6]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage
    devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization,
    service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led
    to growth in cloud computing.,<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup><sup>[9]</sup> By 2019, Linux was the most widely
    used operating system, including in Microsoft's offerings and is thus
    described as dominant.<sup>[10]</sup>The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will screen,
    keep up and gather data about the firewalls, intrusion identification
    or/and counteractive action frameworks and information stream inside the
    network.<sup>[11]</sup>
